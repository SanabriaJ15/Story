My family and i,
always or try to
go to the beach
every weakend if its
nice out when the 
sun is beaming and 
the water is warm.
Like always we would
set a time to
go, but always leave
an hour late. Some 
odd reason it takes 
my family forever 
to get ready knowing 
we had plans to 
go to the beach.
This trip at the 
beach was important to
me beacuse I pushed
my body to its
limit racing my older 
brother and some friends
in a race back 
to our towels. It 
is also and embraressing
time for me as
well because I fated
in front of everybody
at the beach. It
was also a very
satisfying day as well,
beacuse I beat my
older brother in a
race, after all the 
smack talk he was 
giving me about be 
slow. Since me and 
my older brother are 
competitive. We always try 
to one up each 
other flowed by a 
bunch of smack talk 
about who better at 
what and why the 
other person sucks and 
something. These conversation can 
go on all day 
but we both know 
until we face each 
other we will not 
see who is better, 
its just talk. At
this day at the
the smack talk started 
really early on. We 
always talk who faster 
but we really never 
raced until that day 
at the beach. The 
race started after our 
game of football witch 
ended because the ball 
got lost in the 
waves. Witch we later 
found by the peer.
On the way back
thats when we smacked 
talked each other again 
about who is slower.
So my sister come 
to with a race 
that will settle all 
the smack talking.So 
she told us to 
race to the towels 
about 100 meters, full 
on sprint. So she 
started us and the 
race was off he 
was beating me in 
the beginning but then 
everything went black and 
all I can remember 
is I was lying 
down. I know I 
won beacuse my older 
brother told me he 
said I had perfect 
form and I was 
flying. I push myself 
to its limit to 
the point i almost 
died on the beach.
the reason this day 
was important beacuse i 
almost never beat my 
older brother in anything 
but when I finally 
do I feels amazing.
Or course he makes 
fun of me but 
i won the race 
after weeks of smack 
talking. i come out 
the winner.
