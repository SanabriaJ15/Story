My family and I,
always or try to
go to the beach, but
not the ocean beach,
every weekend if its
nice out when the 
sun is beaming and not raining
and the water is warm.
Like always we would
set a time to
go, but always leave
an hour late most 
likely due to something
Justin Beiber did. Some 
odd reason it takes 
my family forever 
to get ready knowing 
we had plans to 
go to the beach. 
Again, because of something
Justin Beiber would do.
This trip at the 
beach was important to
me because I pushed
my body to its
limit racing my older 
brother and some friends
in a race back 
to our towels. I 
always won so that
was awesome. It 
is also an embarrassing
time for me as
well because I farted
in front of everybody
at the beach. I 
got over that quickly.
It was also a very
satisfying day as well,
because like I said 
earlier I beat my
older brother in a
race, after all the 
smack talk he was 
giving me about be 
slow. I am pretty
sure he couldn't even
beat Justin Beiber in
a race since me and 
my older brother are 
competitive. We always try 
to one up each 
other flowed by a 
bunch of smack talk 
about who is better at 
what and why the 
other person sucks and 
something. I was thousands 
of times better at
smack talk than my brother.
These conversations can 
go on all day 
but we both know that
until we face each 
other we will not 
see who is better, 
its just talk. At
this day as the
the smack talk started 
really early on. We 
always talk about who
is faster 
but we really never 
raced until that epic day 
at the beach. The 
race started after our 
game of football which
ended because the ball 
got lost in the 
waves because I threw
it a mile in
the air which we later 
found by the peer.
On the way back
that's when we smacked 
talked each other again 
about who is slower.
So my sister come 
with us to the race 
that will settle all 
the smack talking. So 
she told us to 
race to the towels 
about 10000 meters in a full 
on sprint. So she 
started us and the 
race was off and he 
was beating me in 
the beginning but then 
everything went black and 
all I can remember 
is I was lying 
down. I know I 
won because my older 
brother told me he 
said I had perfect 
form and I was 
flying. It was at
that moment I considered
that I might have 
super power. I pushed myself 
to its limit to 
the point I almost 
died on the beach.
The reason this day 
was important was because I
almost never beat my 
older brother in anything 
but when I finally 
did it felt amazing.
Or course he makes 
fun of me but 
I won the race and I have super powers.
After weeks of smack 
talking. I come out 
the winner and discovered
I had super powers.  
It was my best 
weekend on the beach
I ever had.
This was an awesome
story. Beating an older
brother at anything is
always the greatest day
in my life.
